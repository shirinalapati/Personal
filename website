        <h2>Welcome</h2>
Decolonization is the process by which former colonies achieve independence and break away from their colonial powers. In other words, it is the undoing of colonialism as instead of being subject to a higher foreign authority that controls their land, a state becomes independent. This process especially took place in the 20th century rapidly after World War II. This is because due to the damages of the war, strong imperial European states no longer had the military and infrastructure to hold firm control over their colonies. 
Another reason for the occurrence of this movement was because many colonial subjects fought in both world wars for their colony. Many did this expecting that they would be rewarded with independence after the war was over. Additionally, there was a greater emphasis on democracy around the world after the Allies prevailed over the brutal Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan, who were known for numerous war crimes and executing horrific actions, such as the Holocaust. Consequently, there was a higher motive towards giving colonies independence and allowing them to have their own natural rights. 
However, this didnâ€™t mean that decolonization was always a peaceful process done through negotiations as while European powers gave independence to some of their colonies, there was also violence during decolonization. This is because as seen on this site, you will learn that in places where there was a large European settler population, colonial powers were unwilling to give up their colonies.

                <h2>Decolonization of India</h2>
The Indian Independence Movement is largely known today due to how influential it was. The movement spread rapidly when Mahatma Gandhi became the leader of the Indian National Congress in 1921, after protesting brutal laws against Indians while practicing as a lawyer in South Africa. The movement was centralized around the idea of civil disobedience, where individuals would peacefully protest the oppressive laws they suffered from the British Empire. While most Indians volunteered to fight in the name of Britain in World War I, there were also instances of coercion used to get Indians to fight. Many did this thinking they would be given greater self-rule after the war was over, but they unfortunately didnâ€™t receive this. As a result, the independence movement continued with major nonviolent events like the Salt March in 1930. When World War II broke out, Indians were forced to fight again and after the war concluded, it was a different result for India. They finally received their independence in 1947, butâ€¦
	In 1906, the All-India Muslim League was formed with the desire of creating a new state on the Indian subcontinent specifically for Muslims. This was a result of the widespread divide-and-conquer strategy employed by the British in India throughout their time as its colonizer, in order to solidify their authority over the subcontinent. So, with a big difference between Muslims and Hindus in India, there was support by some Indians and many British people to partition the state. In the end, the state of Pakistan was created, receiving independence on the same day that India received its independence. As a result, many Hindus living in Pakistan migrated to India and many Muslims living in India migrated to Pakistan, but in the process, lots of violence was seen. So, while India peacefully separated from Britain, due to the long-held policies held in place by the British Empire, there was still violence when the states of India and Pakistan became independent.

                <h2>Decolonization of Ghana</h2>
In West Africa, named as the Gold Coast, Ghana was given this name when it was a British colony from 1821 until it received independence in 1957. Vast amounts of gold were found here, hence its name. The British exploited the economy of the native Ghanaians to obtain the raw materials of ivory, pepper, and cocoa, before building lots of infrastructure, such as railways, to export these raw materials back to Britain. Over time, natives in this colony refused to comply with British laws and began boycotting British goods. 
	The independence movement was led by Kwame Nkrumah, a Western-educated man who studied at the London School of Economics. He ended up forming an independence party based on the principles of socialism in the Gold Coast colony called the Convention Peopleâ€™s Party. Nkrumah preached unity among Africans not just in the Gold Coast, but also all throughout Africa. Eventually, his leadership proved to be tremendously successful as Ghana ended up becoming a free state mostly through peace.
	Similar to Gandhi, Nkrumah's strategy involved mass mobilization and civil disobedience, which drew widespread support from various segments of Ghanaian society. His charismatic leadership and persistent advocacy for self-governance culminated in the British agreeing to grant Ghana independence. On March 6, 1957, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African country to break free from colonial rule, setting a precedent for other African nations. Nkrumah became the first Prime Minister and later the first President of Ghana, beginning a new era of African self-determination and inspiring liberation movements across the continent.

                <h2>Decolonization of Algeria</h2>
	Algeria was Franceâ€™s biggest colony, regarded as the crown jewel of their colonial empire, much like Britain's valuation of India. Algeria was even considered an integral part of France, as there was a significant number of French nationals who resided in the North African territory.
As a result, when the National Liberation Front (FLN) was formed in Algeria to fuel calls for independence, France was firm on not granting Algeria independence. This refusal sparked severe levels of violence, setting off the Algerian War of Independence. Both sides committed mass atrocities against each other and employed guerrilla warfare tactics. The conflict saw brutal reprisals, torture, and widespread civilian casualties, making it one of the bloodiest decolonization wars.
With the violence escalating, public opinion in France began to turn against the war, especially among the French Communist Party and intellectuals who decried the human rights abuses. The mounting opposition reached a peak as people realized the untenable nature of retaining Algeria.
Everything started to appear fruitful when Charles de Gaulle stepped into office in 1958, promising to create a plan to eventually grant Algeria independence. After intense negotiations and continued conflict, Algeria officially gained its independence in 1962, marking the end of over a century of French colonial rule and the beginning of a new era for the Algerian people.

                <h2>Decolonization of Angola</h2>
                <p>The decolonization of Angola was part of a broader wave of African independence movements in the mid-20th century. The struggle for independence from Portuguese colonial rule began in the 1950s, with key movements such as the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).</p>
                <p>The conflict escalated into a protracted war, known as the Angolan War of Independence, which lasted from 1961 to 1974. The war saw significant involvement from external powers, including the Soviet Union, the United States, and Cuba, which supported different factions.</p>
                <p>Angola achieved independence on November 11, 1975, following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, which led to the end of Portuguese colonial rule. However, the country soon descended into a civil war that lasted until 2002, significantly impacting its post-independence trajectory.</p>

                <h2>Decolonization of French West Africa </h2>
                <p>
This region was a federation part of the French colonial empire, making up 8 present-day African states: Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Niger. During the Scramble for Africa, European powers carved up Africa with each state agreeing with each other what territories they would control in the continent. With a minimal European settler population in these countries, France used small-scale military forces to consolidate authority in their colonies in this region.
However, domestically in France, there was increasing pressure to provide colonies with independence and gift them the ideals of democracy and freedom. In 1956, France passed loi-cadre (Reform Act) giving greater self-rule to colonies and immediately setting these African states up for independence. 
The loi-cadre marked a turning point, allowing local assemblies more power and enabling African leaders to emerge and advocate for complete independence. The process of decolonization accelerated, and by 1960, all eight of the aforementioned states had achieved independence. Leaders like LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor in Senegal and Ahmed SÃ©kou TourÃ© in Guinea played pivotal roles in negotiating peaceful transitions to sovereignty. This wave of independence was part of a larger movement across Africa, signaling the decline of European colonial empires and the rise of new nations eager to chart their own destinies. So, this is another example of negotiated independence taking place, with power being transferred peacefully.</p>
